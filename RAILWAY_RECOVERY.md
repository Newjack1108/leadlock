# Railway recovery checklist (API 502 / empty app)

## Symptom: frontend loads but no data / login fails

1. Check API health: `https://leadlock-production.up.railway.app/health`
   - `"status": "ok"` and `"database": "ok"` and `"migrations": "complete"` → fully ready.
   - `"row_counts": { "customers": N, "leads": N, "users": N }` → API sees that many rows (compare with Postgres Query tab). If Query shows thousands but `row_counts` is 0, API is on the wrong database URL.
   - `"database": "ok"` and `"migrations": "running"` → **you can use the app**; startup migrations still running (normal for 1–10 min on large DBs).
   - `"database": "initializing"` → API cannot reach Postgres yet; check `DATABASE_URL` (use `postgres.railway.internal` from the Postgres service reference).
   - `"database": "error"` → read `database_error` and fix `DATABASE_URL` (below).

2. **Railway → leadlock (API) → Variables**
   - `DATABASE_URL` must be a **reference** to your **existing** Postgres service (not a new empty DB).
   - `SECRET_KEY` must be set (unchanged from before today).
   - `CORS_ORIGINS` may list extra origins; the API **always** allows `https://www.csgbsales.co.uk` and `https://csgbsales.co.uk` (see `main.py`).  
     If the browser reports CORS but `/health` returns **502**, the API is **down** — fix the API deploy first (CORS headers are not added on Railway’s 502 page).

3. **Railway → Postgres → Data / Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "user";
   ```
   - Counts **> 0** → data exists; fix API URL / auth / CORS.
   - Counts **0** → wrong database or data loss → restore from **Backup** service volume or S3 (`BACKUP_SETUP.md`).

4. **Redeploy** the `leadlock` API service after fixing variables.

## Symptom: `canceling statement due to statement timeout` in deploy logs

We previously set Postgres `statement_timeout` on every connection; that **breaks startup migrations** (`inspector.get_columns("lead")`) and login queries while API + Worker both run `create_db_and_tables()`.

**Fix (API service variables):**

1. Remove `DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` / `DB_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` if you added them.
2. Set **`API_SKIP_STARTUP_MIGRATIONS`** = `true` on the **leadlock API** service only.
3. Keep full migrations on the **Worker** (`python worker.py`) — not on API.
4. Redeploy **Worker first** (wait for `Database initialization complete`), then **API**.
5. Do **not** run API + Worker deploys at the same time.

## Symptom: `/health` shows `row_counts` > 0 but app says “API total: 0”

The browser is **not** using the same API you opened in the address bar for `/health`, or the customers request **failed** and the UI kept `total` at 0.

1. **LeadLock Frontend → Variables** (set before or at deploy; `API_URL` applies at runtime without rebuild):
   - `API_URL` = `https://leadlock-production.up.railway.app`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = same URL (for client bundle)
   - `API_PROXY_TARGET` = same URL (for Next.js `/api` rewrites when using same-origin calls)

2. **Redeploy frontend** after changing variables.

3. While logged in, DevTools → Network:
   - `GET /api/customers` → full URL must be `leadlock-production...`, status **200**, `"total": 577` (or your count).
   - `GET /api/auth/data-summary` → same host, matching counts.

4. Clear URL filters: open `/customers` with no `?has_unread=1` or `?sms_opted_out=1`.

## Symptom: Railway “Application failed to respond” (502)

Railway’s edge could not get a timely response from your container.

1. **Which URL fails?**
   - `https://leadlock-production.up.railway.app` → **API** service.
   - `https://www.csgbsales.co.uk` → usually **frontend** service (custom domain). Fix the service that is red in Railway.

2. **API → Deployments → View logs** (latest deploy). Look for:
   - `HTTP server ready` / `Uvicorn running` → process started; if you still get 502, health check or Postgres may be timing out.
   - `ModuleNotFoundError` / `ImportError` → broken deploy; redeploy from a good commit.
   - `Database connection failed` / `Connection timed out` → Postgres or `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` (see below).
   - Crash loop right after start → check **Settings → Health Check Path** is `/health/live` (not a slow DB-only path).

3. **Postgres** service must be **Online**. On **leadlock (API)** variables:
   - `DATABASE_USE_PUBLIC` = `true`
   - `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` = reference to Postgres → `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`
   - Redeploy API.

4. **Restart**: Postgres → Restart, then API → Redeploy. Wait 2–5 minutes; open `/health/live` (should be instant), then `/health`.

5. **Health check** (Railway → API service → Settings): Path **`/health/live`**, timeout **120s**. Do not use `/health` alone if the DB is slow — it runs `SELECT 1` and can fail deploy health checks.

## Worker service shows “failed” but logs say “All workers running”

The **Worker** is not a web app: it runs `python worker.py` and has no UI. Railway may mark it failed if a **health check** expects HTTP on `$PORT` while nothing was listening.

1. **Worker → Settings → Start Command**: `python worker.py` (Root Directory **`api`**).
2. **Same DB env as API**: `DATABASE_URL`, and if used `DATABASE_USE_PUBLIC` + `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`.
3. **Health check**: path **`/health/live`**, or disable health check on the Worker service only.
4. After deploy `worker.py` with the built-in health server, logs should include `Worker health server on 0.0.0.0:...` then `All workers running`.

Successful worker logs end with:

```text
IMAP polling thread started
Scheduled SMS worker started
Customer outreach worker started
All workers running. Blocking main thread.
```

That is **healthy** — email/SMS/outreach run on the Worker, not on the API (unless `WORKER_MODE=true` on API).

## Symptom: `/health` returns 502

The container is not listening. Check **Deploy logs** for `Database startup failed` or missing `DATABASE_URL`.

## Symptom: `connection to postgres.railway.internal ... Connection timed out`

The API **cannot reach Postgres on Railway’s private network**. The URL format is fine; the **network path** is broken.

**Fix (try in order):**

1. **Same Railway project** — `leadlock` (API), `LeadLock Frontend`, `Postgres`, and `Worker` must all be in **one** project (not a copy of the repo in a second project).

2. **Link services in the UI** (best fix):
   - Open the **Postgres** service → **Connect** (or **Variables** / service connections).
   - Connect it to the **leadlock** API service (and Worker if used).
   - On **leadlock** → **Variables**, use **Add reference** → Postgres → `DATABASE_URL` (do not paste a URL copied from another project).

3. **Confirm Postgres is running** — Postgres service status **Online**, not crashed or deploying.

4. **Workaround: public TCP URL** (if private network still times out):
   - On **Postgres** → **Variables**, find **`DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`** (host looks like `*.proxy.rlwy.net` or similar).
   - On **leadlock** → **Variables**, add:
     - `DATABASE_USE_PUBLIC` = `true`
     - `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` = **reference** to Postgres → `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`
   - Redeploy **leadlock**. The app will use the public proxy (still works from Railway; slightly different routing).

5. **Do not** point `DATABASE_URL` at a Postgres instance from a **different** Railway project or a deleted service — DNS may resolve but nothing listens → timeout.

After a successful connection, deploy logs should show `Database connection OK`. Then check row counts in Postgres Query tab.
